# Common Distribution and Random Variables

It was difficult to find these common distributions online in one place, so here is what I wish I found online.


In the jupyter notebook are some Common Distributions and Random Variables, encoded in PYMC. 

This was done partly for my Master's program in Data Science and the University of San Francisco, for the Bayesian Statistics course.
